    <p>Consensus decision-making has become a go-to method for groups wanting to decide cooperatively. However it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve the conditions for success when groups get bigger, more diverse or dynamic—even groups which have the conditions for consensus can fail to reach it. In the presentation <a href="https://douginamug.gitlab.io/slides/poco_coop_dm/#1">"Post-consensus, cooperative decision-making"</a>, I explore why modified score voting is cooperative and how it can be used to make decisions when consensus isn't possible. <a href="https://ukuvota.world">Ukuvota</a> is an open-source web-app which implements all the features outlined in the presentation, developed by <a href="https://wolfi.space/">Wolfi</a>.</p>

    <p>I co-founded <a href="https://kanthaus.online">Kanthaus</a> to create a place for people to live and work together in a way that is social, ecological and economical.

    <p>A common house is owned, used and maintained by the same group. Common houses are great—and come with their own set of challanges! I wrote a constitution for Kanthaus largely based on Elinor Ostrom's research into how commons succeed (or fail). A copy is now collectively developed by the Kanhaus members: <a href="https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/blob/master/user/pages/40.governance/10.constitution/default.en.md">Kanthaus Constitution</a>.</p>

    <p>So far this site is completely 'hand-written'. Until I figure out how I want to generate posts, check out the <a href="https://kanthaus.online/en/blog">Kanthaus blog</a> for a flavour of what I might be experiencing.</p>

  <div class="about-page">
    <h1>My motivation</h1>
    <p>I believe that life is an absurd gift; my gratitude for receiving it is my fundamental motivation for the work I do. I want to help make life as excellent as possible for all that (will) live, which firstly means reducing unnecessary suffering.</p>
    
    <p>Thankfully, there are already a lot of people already doing something to make things better/less bad: some occupy trees in threatened forests, others distribute surplus food before it's wasted, yet others consider how to ensure AI becomes a benevolent force.</p>
    
    <p>You might assume that people working for the common good must be cooperating: after all, many of the issues such groups face are <i>caused</i> by a lack of cooperation in the first place. However—as I've repeatedly experienced over several years—while most groups are theoretically cooperative, many fail to bring their theory into practice.</p>
    
    <p>Failure to cooperate creates new issues for groups, sometimes so many that groups just split up! The frustration of repeatedly finding groups that wanted to cooperate but failed to do so lead me to study a variety of topics, with the philosophy of science by Karl Popper and the empirical analysis of the commons by Elinor Ostrom being particularly influential. I decided to focus on decision-making (no pun intended) since I've found it to be the practice which groups struggle with most.</p>
    
    <a href="blah.html">sthng</a>
    
<!--
    <p>What about Consensus, isn't that cooperative? Consensus decision-making is the practice of collaboratively developing a proposal everyone can accept (and preferably everyone likes.) Those that developed and teach Consensus recognised a set of <a href="https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus#conditions">conditions</a> which must be present for the practice to succeed. However many groups attempt to use Consensus when these conditions can't be reached—even when it leads to stagnation, frustration and drop-out. In response to the cultural inertia of Consensus, and a seeming lack of alternatives when it's not achievable, I primarily come to the subject of decision-making from a 'post-consensus' perspective.</p>
    
    <p>To address this failure to cooperate, I believe that philosophy and practice must be simultaneously inspected. Influenced by the works of Karl Popper and Elinor Ostrom, I use <i>autonomy</i>, <i>equivalence</i> and <i>mutual-interest</i> as a philosophical framework of cooperation. Regarding practice, 

    <p>I'm motivated to develop truly cooperative organizational practices because I believe they can help people be more effective, efficient and happy! It's my way of expressing gratitude to all those who are out there now, working together to solve issues and make life more worth living.</p>

    <h1>My experiences</h1>
    <p>I was born and brought up in Scotland. My parents took my brothers and I to 'non-Western' countries when we were young. I read a book about a man who decided to live without money ('The Moneyless Man' by Marcus Boyle) when I was sixteen, which made me ditch my 'get-rich' plans. While studying Chemistry at Edinburgh I discovered student activism, coops and other such things. I worked for a multinational spirits company for a year, investigating the how process variables affect Scotch Whisky flavour.</p>
    
    <p>Before my degree ended, I realised I didn't want to start a commercial job or do a PhD. Actually, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I planned to work-exchange and hitchhike around Europe. Two weeks into that plan, I happened to join the beginning of the yunity project. The idea was to recreate the successful foodsharing.de web-app as an open-source, multilingual and extendable platform to enable the foodsharing movement to grow. My time with yunity was quite extraordinary: we hitchhiked from one work-sprint to another, we were gifted accommodation and rescued most of our food from waste. I blogged about the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindbleedofdoug/blog">first year</a>. Due to a variety of factors, the scope of yunity grew ever larger and the productivity towards the initial goal ever lower: with some bemusement I observed a team become a <a href="https://yunity.org/en">network</a>.</p>
    
    <p>A number of people I'd met along the way wanted to continue doing project work with a bit more stability. We got together to make what would become known as Kanthaus.</p>
        
    <h2>My idea of fun</h2>    
    <p>When I'm <i>not</i> doing cooperative process stuff I <del>club seals</del> hitch-hike, read sci-fi/surreal short-stories, do judo, climb trees, camp, watch insects, do yoga, explore abandoned building, forage, brew... </p>
