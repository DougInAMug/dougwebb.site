    <h1>Hi, I'm Doug</h1>
    <p><b>I develop cooperative</b> organizational practices; modular procedures which systematically support people to organize with autonomy, equivalence and mutual-interest. I focus on <b>decision-making (post-consensus).</b></p>

    <p>Many groups with radical values of cooperation choose to make decisions by consensus. Unfortunately, this approach often breaks down when groups get bigger, more diverse or dynamic. In the presentation <a href="https://douginamug.gitlab.io/slides/poco_coop_dm/#1">"Post-consensus, cooperative decision-making"</a>, I explore what it means to make decisions cooperatively when consensus isn't possible and how to do so. <a href="https://ukuvota.world">Ukuvota</a> is an open-source web-app which implements all the features I outline in the presentation, developed by <a href="https://wolfi.space/">Wolfi</a>.</p>

    <p>A common house is owned, used and maintained by the same group. Common houses are great—and come with their own set of challanges! I wrote a constitution based on Elinor Ostrom's research into (successful) commons for Kanthaus (see below) where it is now collectively developed by the members: <a href="https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/blob/master/user/pages/40.governance/10.constitution/default.en.md">Kanthaus Constitution</a>.</p>

    <p>I co-founded <a href="https://kanthaus.online">Kanthaus</a> to provide a place for people to live and work together. We explore the solutions collective living poses to the social, ecological and economical issues of more individualised lifestyles. Together we are figuring out how to share a home and support one another to reach our goals. I use willing humans at Kanthaus as test subjects.</p>

    <h1><pre>Not quite yet...</pre></h1>
    <p>So far this site is completely 'hand-written'. Until I figure out how I want to generate html for blog posts, check out the <a href="https://kanthaus.online/en/blog">Kanthaus blog</a> for a flavour of what I might be experiencing, and my <a href="https://medium.com/@DougInAMug">Medium account</a> for a few things I wrote a while ago.</p>

    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <h2>Work motivation</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of people voluntarily doing something to make things better/less bad: some occupy trees in threatened forests, others distribute surplus food before it's wasted, yet others consider how to make AI a benevolent force.</p>
    
    <p>When people voluntarily work together for the common good, they must be cooperating—right? After all, many issues such groups face are <i>caused</i> by a lack of cooperation in the first place.</p>
    
    <p>Not necessarily, as I've discovered after several years of volunteering with various initiatives. Some groups have cooperative values, but a lack of structure results in an authoritative or competitive experience. In other cases, groups adopt practices which are cooperative in theory, but not in practice.</p>
    
    <p>To address this failure to cooperate, I believe that philosophy and practice must be simultaneously inspected. Influenced by the works of Karl Popper and Elinor Ostrom, I use <i>autonomy</i>, <i>equivalence</i> and <i>mutual-interest</i> as a philosophical framework of cooperation. Regarding practice, I focus on decision-making since I've found it to be the practice groups struggle with most.</p>
    
    <p>What about Consensus, isn't that cooperative? Consensus decision-making is the practice of collaboratively developing a proposal everyone can accept (and preferably everyone likes.) Those that have thought through and teach Consensus have recognised a set of <a href="https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus#conditions">conditions</a> which must be present for the practice to succeed. However many groups attempt to use Consensus when these conditions can't be reached—even when it leads to stagnation, frustration and drop-out. In response to the cultural inertia of Consensus, and a seeming lack of alternatives when it's not achievable, I primarily come to the subject of decision-making from a 'post-consensus' perspective.</p>

    <p>I'm motivated to develop truly cooperative organizational practices because I believe they can help people be more effective, efficient and happy! It's my way of expressing gratitude to all those who are out there now, working together to solve issues and make life more worth living.</p>

    <h2>Relevant experiences</h2>
    <p>I was born and brought up in Scotland. My parents took my brothers and I to 'non-Western' countries when we were young. I read a book about a man who decided to live without money ('The Moneyless Man' by Marcus Boyle) when I was sixteen, which brought my 'get-rich' plan into question. While studying Chemistry at Edinburgh I got involved in student activism, coops and other such things. I worked for a multinational spirits company for a year investigating the how process variables affect Scotch Whisky flavour.</p>
    
    <p>Before my degree ended, I realised I didn't want to start a commercial job or do a PhD. Actually, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I planned to work-exchange and hitchhike around Europe. Two weeks into that plan, I happened to join the beginning of the yunity project. The idea was to recreate the foodsharing.de web-app as an open source, multilingual and extendable platform. My time with yunity was quite extraordinary: we hitchhiked from one meeting to another, were gifted accommodation and rescued most of our food from waste. I blogged about the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindbleedofdoug/blog">first year</a>. Due to a variety of factors, the scope of yunity grew ever larger and the productivity towards the initial goal ever lower: with some bemusement I observed a team become a <a href="https://yunity.org/en">network</a>.</p>
    
    <p>A number of people I'd met along the way wanted to continue doing project work with a bit more stability. We got together to make what would become known as Kanthaus.</p>
        
    <h2>My idea of fun</h2>    
    <p>When I'm <i>not</i> doing cooperative process stuff I <del>club seals</del> hitch-hike, read sci-fi/surreal short-stories, do judo, climb trees, camp, watch insects, do yoga, explore abandoned building, forage, brew...</p>
