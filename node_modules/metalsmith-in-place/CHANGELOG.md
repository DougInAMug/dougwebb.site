### 4.0.0 - January 4, 2018
So this library went through a bit of churny phase, my apologies for that. It was caused by a couple
of factors; moving the library to a new home, a new rendering engine and me trying to abstract said
rendering engine for reuse in metalsmith-layouts.

However, the end result is now a stable plugin, that's easy to use and easy to maintain.
Jstransformers are way simpler to debug, and so far I haven't even encountered any bugs. We're not
abstracting the rendering engine because it's just not worth it, and confusing apis have been
removed. All in all I hope that you'll enjoy this release and feel free to let me know if you
encounter anything!
