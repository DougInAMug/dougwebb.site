# The White Bike
### a.k.a. On-One Pompetamine Alfine 8
#### a.k.a. Doug's bike

---

# Prelude
- Started biking a lot at Uni, 2011
- OK bike gifted to me by neighbor
- Lots of gear/brake issues and fixing
- Eventually got stolen :(

---

# A new bike
- Needed another bike
- In 2014 I would commute by bike ~20 Km per day
- Time to get a 'good bike' (i.e. decent components, disc brakes, hub gear)
- I considered building my own
- I did a *lot* of research
- I found a bike with the things I wanted cheaper than I could make it
- I bought an 'On-One Pompetamine Alfine 8' for for Â£600 in April 2013

# History
### 2013 - 2015
Heavy, daily riding. I did a lot of maintainance and got to know the bike very well: it pretty much became an extension of my body :)

### 2015 - 2017
Bike was mostly in storage while I was yunity-ing :(

### 2017
Brought to Kanthaus...

# Depersonalization
### Good:
- Bike became regularly used by many people because of good condition
- Nick bike trailer hitch attached
- Regularly used for dumpser diving

### Not so good
- Bike light went missing
- Seat post regularly not at my height
- Lock/key often in different places
  - I cannot reliably 'grab' the bike
- Missing component (brake cap) not replaced
  - Demotivating to do maintainance.
- Use conflict with community re dumpster diving
  
---

## Two separate issues
- Community desire to have decent bike/trailer for dumpster diving.
- My desire to have a decent bike in a predictable state that I can take without discussion.

<!--
## Options to solve both issues 'easily'
- We move the hitch to another bike and I personalize the white bike more
- We buy another hitch for another bike and I personalize the white bike more
- We keep the hitch on the white bike and I personalize another one
