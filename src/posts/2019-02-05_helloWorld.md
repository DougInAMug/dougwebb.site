Although this isn't the first post on this site, it is the first since it went up. Before this I was using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which needed go and seemed far too complicated. While far from satisfaction, I'd better swallow the bitter pill of the iterative philosophy I profess and publish my site changes so far, namely:

- moving to [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/)
- a posts section
- simplified content
- contact icons on first page
- lot's of 'tidying'

I intend to go into a bit more detail about the technical aspects later. For now I'll say goodbye (world).
