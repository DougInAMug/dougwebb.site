          <h1>Redesigning a cash box</h1>
          <p>Today I was transferring coins from the <a href="https://kanthaus.online">Kanthaus</a> donation jar to the cash box for the first time. This turned out to be surprisingly difficult and I took the opportunity to redesign it better. The box looked like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="postImages/cashBoxPre.jpg"/></p>

<p>Here the coins are separated into three horizontal trays and two containers. Each tray contains a mixture of coins as indicated by labels written on their bases, from top to bottom: 20c &amp; 1c, 50c &amp; 2c and €1 &amp; 10c. The tube container is marked for €2 and the egg-shaped one for 5c. This design is difficult to use since:</p>

<ul><li>the tray labels are covered by the coins, making the mixtures look random,</li><li>the order of coins follows no obvious pattern, meaning the place for each coin has to be learned independently,</li><li>the €2 and 5c coins are in closed containers meaning different visual identification are required (i.e. image of coin vs. label,)</li><li>the €2 and 5c containers must be opened, meaning two types of physical action are required to place coins (i.e. dropping into place vs. opening and adding,)</li></ul>

<p>The negative consequences of this design perhaps become clearer when considering the options I was faced with:</p>

<ol><li><strong>learn the design</strong> with its unnecessary complexity, wasting my time and that of future users,</li><li><strong>break the design</strong> by throwing the coins in randomly, wasting the time of users now familiar with the current design,</li><li><strong>avoid the design</strong> by giving up on the task, leading to a centralization of work on fewer users,</li><li><strong>re-design</strong> to be more intuitive for new and current users.</li></ol>

<p>I chose the last option. I added cardboard spacers to the trays to make one section for each type of coin and ordered the sections from most valuable coin to least:</p>

<p>These relatively small changes greatly simplify the process of sorting coins: a user now simply needs to visually match the coin (one identification) and drop them into place (one action). The observant reader will realise this &#39;new&#39; design closely resembles a standard money tray. Copying or mimicking popular designs is not just flattering, it reduces the amount of education or guess-work users need to understand the intended usage.</p>

<p>The responsibility for designers to understand potential user needs was impressed upon me by reading Don Norman&#39;s book, <a href="http://www.nixdell.com/classes/HCI-and-Design-Spring-2017/The-Design-of-Everyday-Things-Revised-and-Expanded-Edition.pdf">&#39;The Design of Everyday Things.&#39;</a> Don explains how fantastically error-prone and cognitively-limited humans are, and that the effort of learning is increased with every new procedure a person has to learn. Designers, being completely familiar with their own designs, can be blinded to the difficulties users will face unless they&#39;re careful.</p>

<p>Having empathy for users seems to be critical to good design. Indeed the &#39;goodness&#39; of a design appears to be dependent on users experience, not the designer&#39;s opinion. Through good design we help people use their time and effort more effectively with fewer mistakes; designers should share their users joy. Happy designing and user-testing!</p>
