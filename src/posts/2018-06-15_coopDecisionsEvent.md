What should we do when consensus can't be reached? What if cooperative decision-making is better achieved in such cases with practices other than "reaching consensus"?

![](../postImages/pccdm_dmexpanded.png)

For decades people wishing to organize in more cooperative ways have been encouraged to make decisions by consensus, and for good reason: when it works well, it's awesome. However—when it doesn't work—it can lead to  guilt, frustration; organizational paralysis or disintegration.

In these talks I will explore how score voting can provide a simple, scalable and systematically cooperative alternative to the often utopian ideal of consensus—and explain how to do it.
