          <h1>Curiosity conundrum</h1>
          <p><em>Curiosity killed the cat</em>, so they say. A warning: questions mean consequences! While it may bring some felines a premature departure, my concern is the consequences it has on me while <em>alive</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s say curiosity is a desire to know, experience or understand. Sometimes it’s for a reason, that I need some knowledge to do a thing (a means to an end). Sometimes there’s no other purpose, just the joy of discovery (end in itself). Reading, theorising, travelling, playing… there seems to be an unlimited number of ways to be curious.</p>
<p>My issue is somewhat paradoxical. In embracing my curiosity I become <em>more</em> curious. The more I learn, the more I’m aware of what I don’t know; the more I explore, the more I realise how much there is to discover. At the end of a scientific paper, there’s a list of references to other papers, each in turn with its own list of references and so on. A positive feedback loop of desire with no accompanying increase in time, brain-power or body parts.</p>
<p>This leads to the disconcerting feeling that the more I learn, the <em>less</em> I know. In dark moments (Wikipedia trawling into the early hours) it even feels like learning <em>decreases</em> my intelligence. Many times I understand the temptation of dogmatic ignorance, but I don’t think that is an option for me.</p>
<p>[cypherSteak]</p>
<p>Consider books. Books are like bricks of materialized information, sliced into pages. As you read through one, you can gradually sense the weight shifting from the back to the front as you turn the pages, like a tactile indicator of profress. You can even write in notes, and in doing so customise the book to a uniquely modified version. (I’m not just a defendant of writing in books, I’m an advocate!)</p>
<p>Libraries, then, are like temples <em>of</em> information. Books, like bricks, forming walls. I feel small when I look into the night sky, sometimes to the point of insignificance, yet somehow insulated by the distance to the celestial bodies. Libraries, smaller, intimidate me far more: a mass of knowledge, so big it’s unknowble, <em>within grasp</em>.</p>
<p>Certainly there are some small libraries which one might eventually be able to fully read through. However even a life’s dedication to reading wouldn’t scratch the surface of the tens of millions of books in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_libraries">largest libraries</a>—and even those contain but a fraction of all books! A prescient vision of the current situation was made almost00 years ago by Denis Diderot in his <em>“Encyclopédie”</em> (1755):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As long as the centuries continue to unfold, the number of books will grow continually, and one can predict that a time will come when it will be almost as difficult to learn anything from books as from the direct study of the whole universe. It will be almost as convenient to search for some bit of truth concealed in nature as it will be to find it hidden away in an immense multitude of bound volumes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most ‘immense multitude of bound volumes’ is without doubt the <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/Borges/libraryofbabel.pdf">Library of Babel</a>. This library, that lives within a short story of the same name by Jorge Luis Borges, <em>“is composed of an indefinite, perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries”</em>. Each galley contains 4 bookshelves, each filled with books of <em>“four hundred ten pages; each page, forty lines; each line, approximately eighty black letters”</em>. Each book contains a unique text such that the <em>“bookshelves contain all possible combinations of the twenty-two orthographic symbols”</em>.</p>

<p>The Library of Babel contains All Books. All the books you’ve read, all that you haven’t, those lost to history, that book you were thinking about writing one day and even <em>“the true story of your death”</em>. At the prospect of this absurd library, with a vastness as incomprehensible as space, I once again relax.</p>

<p>^^^happy with above^^^</p>
<p>This isn’t just about books. This is about beaches, meetings, houses, films, seas, rainforests, campaigns, projects, lovers, friends… the desire to experience facing up to human limits. Much as it pains me, I must accept I can’t read all the books, visit all the places, nor <em>x</em> all the <em>y</em>. On the rational, conscious level I’ve always know this, but other parts still find it hard to accept.</p>
<p>where to go? I don’t want to resolve this, can’t. guess with the contemplation of limitedness, there is a pressure to choose something. the right choices are unknown, so trying necessary… iteration.</p>
<p>Earlier I gave reasons: learning to achieve something and learning for the fun of it. </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this means my curiosity is <em>unsatiable</em>.</p>
<p>David Foster Wallace, This is Water <a href="http://metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf">http://metastatic.org/text/This%20is%20Water.pdf</a></p>
<p>“there is  actually  no such thing as  atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.  And  an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God … is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. … Worship your intellect, being seen as smart —  you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.”</p>
<p>Popper’s translation of Xenophanes:</p>
<p>The gods did not reveal, from the beginning,
All things to us, but in the course of time
Through seeking we may learn and know things better.
But as for certain truth, no man has known it,
Nor shall he know it, neither of the gods
Nor yet of all the things of which I speak.
For even if by chance he were to utter
The final truth, he would himself not know it:
For all is but a woven web of guesses.</p>
