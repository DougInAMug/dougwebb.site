"Curiosity killed the cat", so the saying goes. It seems like a warning: question things and face the consequences! And I agree that there are consequences. While curiosity may lead to premature death, I write here about the consequences it presents the living.

The desire to know—by experience or understanding—is the essence of my curiosity. Sometimes I seek knowledge in order to do something else (a means to an end), sometimes simply because I like learning (an end in itself). Reading books, developing theory, travelling to places I've never been before, testing designs: this desire takes many forms.

The curse of curiosity is that pursuing it fuels it. It's a positive feedback loop. The more I learn, the more I know I don't know; the more I explore, the more I realise how much there is to discover. At the end of an interesting paper, there's a list of references to other papers, each with it's own list of references and so forth. I feel the rate of 'unknowing' accelerates as I learn, such that the fraction of 'known unknowns' increases the more I know.

Books are like materialized knowledge. You can experience the weight slowly shifting from the back to the front as you read from the mass of turned pages. Libraries, then, are like temples _of_ knowledge. Books like bricks, forming walls.

It might be possible to read the contents of a town library in a number of years, but even a small city library is beyond readability. The millions of books in the largest libraries present an impossible challenge to anyone willing to try. Yet even the largest library contains a fraction: a mass of books you can touch, but never read. A prescient vision of the current situation was made by Denis Diderot over 200 years ago in "Encyclopédie" (1755) when he writes:

> "As long as the centuries continue to unfold, the number of books will grow continually, and one can predict that a time will come when it will be almost as difficult to learn anything from books as from the direct study of the whole universe. It will be almost as convenient to search for some bit of truth concealed in nature as it will be to find it hidden away in an immense multitude of bound volumes."

Technological progress in book classification and digitalization since Diderot's time makes it easier to locate books. However that same progress has lowered the barrier to publication (allowing you to read this) and dramatically _increased_ the body of written work. Perhaps AI will nicely digest it all and summarize it for us, but it's now safe to say no one can directly read it all.

Through different combinations of ink on paper a seemingly endless number of books could be made.

Books represent yet again a small portion of what can be known: films, music, trades...

So why do those who believe everything is connected, and that only a minute fraction thereof can known, assume that anything can be fully comprehended?
