          <h1>Introducing Kanthaus</h1>
          <p>Two shabby buildings in a German town you’ve probably never heard of before have become home for a group of post-waste activists: we call it <a href="https://kanthaus.online">Kanthaus</a>. </p>
<p><img src="../postImages/sunnyDayKH.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Located within the mesh of global challenges is the fact that 1/3 of edible food isn’t eaten. The issue of waste is a focal point for our project, inherited from our involvement with <a href="https://yunity.org/en">yunity.org</a> and <a href="https://foodsharing.de/">foodsharing.de</a>. We believe that most waste is due to outdated economics and that sharing provides solutions. Kanthaus is a platform for people to promote sharing and/or reduce waste.</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Doug. I fell into this project early on and I’ll present about the history, first 6 months and future plans—</p>
