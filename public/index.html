    <h1>Hello, I'm Doug</h1>
    <p>I develop processes to help people live and work more cooperatively by building on the successes of coops and commons.</p>

    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <p>I design cooperative processes; why?</p>
    
    <p>There are some challenging problems for humanity. For example: global warming, food waste or dramatic economic imbalances (which is amplified by automation and AI.) We might hope that such problems are solved through technological progress, government legislation, individual choices, or market forces, but unfortunately, these powers often <i>cause</i> the problems.</p>
    
    <p>Fortunately, many people are involved in associations based on cooperation such as communities, groups, unions, networks, commons, coops, etc. Over the last years I've had some great experiences with the Shrub coop, the yunity network and Kanthaus commons. However cooperating is not straight-forward due to a general lack of practice.</p>
    
    <p>The reason I focus on process over values is due to several observations. 1) processes give people direct experiences 2) process can be much more objectively tested 3) many processes I've seen are inconsistent with stated values. I've seen groups with lovely values do bad things due to process. My attention is currently (2018-09-14) still on decision-making which I believe is one of the most significant processes in any organization.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not doing cooperative design stuff I <del>club seals</del> hitch-hike, read sci-fi/philosophy/surreal short-stories, do judo, climb trees...</p>

    <img src="mutualInterest.png" alt="a yin and yang esque image of two people thinking about each other" style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:50%">
    <p>In an effort to be as cooperative as possible, some groups attempt to make decisions by consensus. In many cases this works very well. However, when groups get bigger, more diverse or dynamic, this approach can break down. By considering the anatomy of decision-making, and what it means be cooperative, I put forward several features for such systems.</p>

    <p><i>Fundamental agreements for a common house</i> | mid-2017 - present </p>
    <p>Used by commoners, companies and pirates, constitutions have a proven utility. This constitution was largely inspired by the studies into Commons done by Elinor</p>

    <p>Nomadic life is very inspiring, but it's challenging to be productive and give something backâ€”as I and a sub-group of the yunity network discovered. I co-founded Kanthaus in late-2017 to provide a place for people to live and work together, cooperatively and ecologically.</p>
