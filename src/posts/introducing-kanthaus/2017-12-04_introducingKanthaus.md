Two shabby buildings in a German town you've probably never heard of before have become home for a group of post-waste activists: we call it [Kanthaus](https://kanthaus.online).

Located within the mesh of global challenges is the fact that 1/3 of edible food isn't eaten. The issue of waste is a focal point for our project, inherited from our involvement with [yunity.org](https://yunity.org/en) and [foodsharing.de](https://foodsharing.de/). We believe that waste can be avoided, and relationsips built, through sharing. Kanthaus is a platform for people to promote sharing and/or reduce waste.

I fell into this project early on and I'll present about the history, the first 6 months and future plansâ€”

- on Friday 15th December, 17:30 as a standalone event at The Shrub, 13 Guthrie Street, Edinburgh EH1 1JG. This will be an interactive \~45 minute presentation with time for further discussion afterwards.
