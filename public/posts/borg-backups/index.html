          <h1>Borg backups</h1>
          <p><i>17th Mar 2020</i></p>
          <p>Long overdue a proper backup setup, prompted by a housemate’s presentation on the topic, I decided to give Borg a bash.</p>
<p>Until know I’ve been periodically/sporadically backing up my home folder to an external harddrive with <code>rsync</code>:</p>
<pre><code>rsync -r -t -v -p -t -E --progress --delete -l -H -s /home/doug/ /run/var/media/harddisk </code></pre><p>This is definitely better than copy-pasting, but 1) it is not encrypted, meaning anyone with access to the drive can read my data 2) it takes quite a lot of time 3) it gives only one monolithic backup, meaning I only have the option of reverting to the last backup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a>, a.k.a. ‘Borgbackup’ is a <em>“Deduplicating archiver with compression and encryption”</em>. It is the de facto successor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_(backup_software)#Borg">Attic</a> since 2015, from which it was forked <em>“to allow some different approaches to development, goals and policy”</em>[<a href="https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/1">ref</a>] From a user perspective, it lets you make <strong>quick, space-efficient, password-protected backups.</strong></p>
<p>For Debian/Ubuntu users, installing Borg is a simple <code>sudo apt install borgbackup</code>. Borg is a command line tool! For those not so keen on The Black Box, there is <a href="https://vorta.borgbase.com/">Vorta</a> which provides a nice graphical user interface for Borg. However the Vorta team <a href="https://vorta.borgbase.com/usage/">notes</a> that it <em>“is currently in beta-testing and shouldn’t be your only backup solution.”</em> (2020-03-17) which put me off using it for now (although I know at least one person who is happily using it.) There is also <a href="https://torsion.org/borgmatic/">Borgmatic</a> which essentially allows borg via config files: although this provides some convenience, I couldn’t justify the additional complexity for my relatively modest requirements.</p>
<p>So to start with I’m just using plain Borg. There is some very nice <a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">documentation</a> and even a couple of <a href="https://asciinema.org/~borgbackup">screencasts</a>. The <a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html">Quick start</a> is as concise as I can imagine one could be, so I won’t repeat that here. Rather I’ll just go over a couple things that were of particular interest to me</p>
<h2 id="viewing-backups-via-borg-mount">Viewing backups via <code>borg mount</code></h2>
<p>After always having done unencrypted backups, where I could directly see the results, it’s important for me know I can really access the archive contents later. The simplest way to do so seems to be with <code>borg mount ...</code>. If you’re backing up files which require root access there are some quirks:</p>
<p>Create a temporary mount directory…</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /tmp/tempBorgMount</code></pre><p>Mount the borg archive. Get the names of your archives with <code>borg list ...</code>. Use the special <code>::</code> to indicate a particular archive…</p>
<pre><code>sudo borg mount /path/to/archives::a-particular-archive /tmp/tempBorgMount</code></pre><p>View files by 1) navigating as root…</p>
<pre><code>sudo su</code></pre><pre><code>cd /tmp/tempBorgMount</code></pre><p>or 2) opening a file browser with root permission…</p>
<pre><code>sudo nemo</code></pre><p>The last two points threw me a bit, because when I tried to access the mount point with <code>sudo</code> I received <code>sudo: cd: command not found</code>. <code>cd</code> is not available for <code>sudo</code>, because if you need root privileges to access a folder, you continue to need it to view it’s contents!</p>
<h2 id="regular-pruning">Regular pruning</h2>
<p>Pruning, like the horticultural act, is about removing unwanted bits. As time passes, you might be happy to get rid of more backups. <code>borg prune ...</code> allows you to do this programmatically. You can specify the number of backups you keep over a time interval with options <code>--keep-weekly</code>, <code>--keep-monthly</code>, etc. These options specify <em>the number of copies to keep within that time period</em>.</p>
<p>For example <code>borg prune --keep-weekly 2</code> will remove all of the oldest backups which exceed 2 for a given week. If you made a backup every day for a week, then ran this command, it would prune Monday to Friday and keep just Saturday and Sunday. By combining daily, weekly, monthly and yearly options, you can have a nicely tapering set of backups, ensuring you always have enough space.</p>
<h2 id="scriptification">Scriptification</h2>
<p>I don’t like remembering loads of commands :) Fortunately there is a nice borg script templated in <a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#automating-backups">the docs</a> I made some modifications, such as excluding trash and downloads folders from being backed-up. I also didn’t include my password: I’ll still be ‘manually’ doing back ups for now, and don’t mind entering my password every time.</p>
