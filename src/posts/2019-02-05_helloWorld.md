While far from satisfaction, I'd better swallow the bitter pill of the iterative philosophy I profess and publish my site improvements so far, namely:

- moving to [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/)
- a posts section
- simplified content
- contact icons on first page
- lot's of 'tidying'

I intend to go into a bit more detail about the technical aspects later. For now, with this post primarily for testing, I'll say goodbye (world).
