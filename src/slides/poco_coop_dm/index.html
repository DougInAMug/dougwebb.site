## Post-consensus, cooperative decision-making
- **Why** it's important
- **What** it is precisely
- **How** it can be done

---

## About me 

- spent ~ 18 months with a sharing focused software project
- nomadic, living almost without money
- now a [project network](https://yunity.org/en)

<img src="img/wuppdaysMalo.jpg" width=75%>

---

## About me

- spent last year building a common house coop
- built in what I'd learned previously
- it's called [Kanthaus](https://kanthaus.online)

# Why

---

## The race for cooperation
  
Growing movement towards cooperation...
- permaculture, commons, coops
- lean, agile, scrum, teal, sociocracy,
- activists, collectives, grassroots groups

--

...response to global problems...
- ecological resource destruction
- global warming
- excessive inequality

--

...many of which are symptoms of
- hierarchies
- majority-rule
- 'capitalism'

--

Critical question for alternatives:
- **how do we make decisions?**

---

## Collective decision-making

**Cooperatives.** Associations with legally enshrined member equality. Principle 2 of 7:

> _"2. Democratic Member Control. ... members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) ..."_

> —[ICA Co-operative Principles](https://www.ica.coop/en/whats-co-op/co-operative-identity-values-principles)

**Commons.** Associations formed around the sustainable use of a resource. The 3rd of 8 features exhibited by long-standing commons:

> _"3. Collective-choice arrangements. Most individuals affected by the operational rules can participate in modifying the operational rules."_

> —Elinor Ostrom, [Governing the Commons](http://wtf.tw/ref/ostrom_1990.pdf)

---

## Consensus

</video>
]

---

## Consensus framework

> _Step 1: Introduce and clarify the issue(s) to be decided_ ...

> _Step 2: Explore the issue and look for ideas_  ...

> _Step 3: Look for emerging proposals_ ... 

> _Step 4: Discuss, clarify and amend your proposal_ ...  

> _Step 5: Test for agreement ... _**Consensus: No blocks, not too many stand asides or reservations? Active agreement? Then we have a decision!** [else back to Step 3]
 
> _Step 6: Implement the decision_ ...

> —Seeds for Change, [Consensus Flowchart](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/consflow.pdf) (emphasis added)

- most of consensus isn't deciding!
- 

---

## Consensus: recent history

- 1920: US women no longer excluded from voting
- _depression, war, growing ecological crises_
- 1960: anti-nuclear activists wish to organize:
  - without hierarchy
  - without 'structurelessness' (-> hierarchy)
  - without majority voting
  - ... Quakers suggest consensus
- 1960+: consensus normalised within activisism, coops, communities...
- 2013: occupy heavily promotes consensus   

---

## Consensus: When it is good

- **Deep listening**
  - _often a first time for participants, therapeutic_
- **Promotes the understanding of others**
  - _encourages the confrontation of awkward topics_
- **Ethic of care**
  - _trying to find something everyone can accept_
- **Social function**
  - _meetings are a regular, social interaction)
- **Creative**
  - _dialogue brings up novel ideas_

--

<br>

>> _'When it is good,_  

>> _It is very good indeed,_  

> _But when it is bad it is horrid'_
]

---

## Consensus: When it is bad

- **Take ages**
  - _survival of the fittest, burnout, frustration_
- **Conceals hierarchy** 
  - _charisma, eloquence, appeal, race, sex_
- **Reduces group intelligence**
  - _anchoring, groupthink, pluralistic ignorance_
- **Conservative dictators**
  - _sociopaths can keep things the way they are_
- **Philosophical crises when unachievable**
  - _"we're not cooperative any more"_
  
--

<br>

_These disadvantages are mostly due to process, not participants!_

---

## Consensus: casualties

**Historical**
- Collapse of [Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberum_veto) ~1650-1750

--

**Recent**
- Progress stifled in [Anti-nuclear movement](https://libcom.org/files/consensus.pdf) ~1970-1980
- Unsustainable latency in [Occupy](http://occupywallst.org/article/occupiers-stop-using-consensus/) ~2013

--

**Present**
- many users I've talked to
  - _"meetings go on for so long, I've stopped attending"_
  - _"only the confident block, the power imbalance remains"_
  - _"one person kept blocking: gradually everyone left"_
  - ...
 
---

class: center, middle

## Why: summary

- movement towards cooperation
- decision-making is critical
- consensus not always cooperative
- cooperative alternative to consensus required

# What

---

## Decision-making: as selection

We often think of deciding as selecting...

<img src="img/decisionAsSelection.png">

---

## Decision-making: as cutting

... but it's clearer to think of it as eliminating.

<img src="img/decisionAsCutting.png" width=60% >

> _"decide (v.) ... from Latin_ decidere ... _literally_ **"to cut off"**" 

> —[Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/word/decide)

---

## Decision-making: in detail

A basic model for the sub-processes during collective decision-making

<img src="img/dmDetail.png" width=100%>

1. forming opinions (_outwith process scope_)
2. compressing opinions (a.k.a. voting (_yes, there is voting in consensus_))
3. combining opinions

---

## Decision-making: in context

Antecedes option creation, precedes decision implementation.

<img src="img/creativeDecisiveActive.png" width=100%>

---

## Post-consensus

Failure to reach consensus, often due to group being...

--

- too diverse

  - perception
  - ethics, norms, culture
  
--

- too dynamic
  - people coming and leaving
  - people not wanting to spend time
  
--

- too big
  - numbers
  - distributed in space
  
--

<br>

_However diversity, dynamism and scale are often desirable!_
  
---

## Small, stable, similar groups: consensus possible

**Scrum teams**

> _"Having more than _**nine**_ members requires too much coordination. Large Development Teams generate too much complexity for an empirical process to be useful."_

> —[The Scrum Guide™](http://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

**Affinity groups**

> _"The size of an affinity group can range from _**two to, say, fifteen**_ ... no group should be so numerous that an informal conversation about pressing matters is impossible."_

> —[Destructables tutorial](http://destructables.org/node/54)

**Bible study groups**

> _"the ideal size of a small group is _**six to fifteen**_ people."_

> —[Small Group Churches article](http://www.smallgroupchurches.com/the-ideal-small-group-size/)

---

## Dunbar's estimate

Study on front-brain vs group size suggests a cognitive limit to social relations 
> --> limit to shared perception 
>> --> limit on consensus.

<img src="img/dunbar.jpg" width=80%>

---

## Cooperation

- subjective: no fixed definition
- philosophy of consensus seems to be:
  - "one for all, all for one"
  - "acceptable for everyone"
- what about philosophy of cooperation?

--

I'm putting forward a philosophy of cooperation based on 3 values:
- autonomy
- equivalence
- mutual-interest

---

## Cooperation: autonomy

a.k.a. **Freedom, self-determination, _Liberté_**

<img src="img/autonomy.png">

Regarding decision-making:
- people determine outcome (vs. chance, lottery)
- people can participate honestly (i.e. don't have to lie)

---

## Cooperation: equivalence

a.k.a. **Equality of worth, _Égalité_**

<img src="img/equivalence.png" width=60%>

Regarding decision-making:
- _'one person, one vote'_
- vs. one-£-one vote, dictatorship, racism, etc

---

## Cooperation: mutual-interest

a.k.a. **Care for others, mutual-aid, _Fraternité_**

<img src="img/mutualInterest.png" width=50%>

Regarding decision-making:
- **?**

---

## _Utilitarianism_

> _"... it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong."_

> —Jeremy Bentham, 1776. _A fragment on Government_

<img src="img/utilityBalanceEven.png" width=50%>

- increasing happiness = reducing suffering
- would you give a cake to:
  - starving person (reduce suffering)
  - person who just ate dinner (increase happiness)

---

## _Asymmetric utilitarianism_
    
> _"... the promotion of happiness is in any case much less urgent than the rendering of help to those who suffer, and the attempt to prevent suffering."_

> —Karl Popper, 1945. _The Open Society and Its Enemies_

<img src="img/utilityBalanceWeighted.png" width=45%>

- increasing happiness < reducing suffering
- would you give a cake to:
  - **starving person**
  - ~~person who just ate dinner~~
  
---

## Cooperation: mutual-interest

a.k.a. **Care for others, mutual-aid, _Fraternité_**

<img src="img/mutualInterest.png" width=55%>

Regarding decision-making:
- select the **most acceptable, achievable option**
- vs. majority preference

---

class: center, middle

# What: summary

**Decision-making:** 
- selecting by cutting

**Post-consensus:**
- failure to reach consensus
- too big, diverse or dynamic for consensus

**Cooperative:** 
- autonomous, equivalent and mutually-interested 
- most acceptable, achievable option

---

class: center, middle

# How

---

## Decision-making in detail

Examination of how each element can support cooperation.

<img src="img/dmDetail.png" width=100%>

1. options
2. voting
3. combining

---

## Options: you need at least two

Otherwise there is nothing to 'decide' on.

<img src="img/creativeDecisiveActive.png" width=100%>

---

## Options: something or nothing

One option must be to _change something_ (a specific proposal, 𝝙).  
There is always the option to _change nothing_ (the current status quo, 0). 

<img src="img/creativeDecisiveActiveBinary.png" width=100%>

_(The counter-proposal in consensus is what happens if proposal fails, usually further discussion.)_

---

## Options: wait, binary is bad

You probably want _more_ than two.

<img src="img/brexitQuestion.png" width=70%>

---

## Options: wait, binary is bad

You probably want _more_ than two.

<img src="img/brexitQuestionHighlighted.png" width=70%>

- Vague proposals lead to conflict if selected
- Specific proposals are polarizing

---

## Options: more, but not too many

Having more options increases the likelihood of acceptable option for all... 

<img src="img/creativeDecisiveActivePoly.png" width=95%>

...and participant overload.

---

## Options: revote on other options

Having _"Revote on other options"_ ensures an acceptable option for all without overloading.

<img src="img/creativeDecisiveActiveROOO.png" width=100%>

Should outline:
- arrangements for adding new options, and
- arrangements for next vote

---

## Voting: independent, not secret

In rock-paper-scissors the play is independent, not secret.

<img src="img/rockPaperScissors.png" width=50%>

--

- independent voting forces people to think for themselves

  - avoids [anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) (first person influences rest)
  - avoids [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) (desire for harmony over-rides honesty)
  - avoids [pluralistic ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance) (falsely assumed norms)
  
--

- cooperative groups need not vote in secret (most cases)
  - encourages people to address issues
  - reveals the people likely to do the work

(_N.b. It's possible to use voting within consensus simply to combat biases._)

---

## Voting type: majority

Vote for favorite. 

<img src="img/votingMedal.png" width=25%>

- problems: vote splitting, wasted votes, lesser evil, etc.
- can't express positive/negative opinion

---

## Voting type: ranking

Rank options best to worst.

<img src="img/votingMedals.png" width=75%>

Better than majority, but...

---

## Voting type: ranking

Unavoidable paradoxes and manipulation strategies present whenever there are more than 3 options, as shown by [Arrows Impossibility Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem) then [Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard%E2%80%93Satterthwaite_theorem).

<img src="img/impossTheorem.png" width=60%>

- and participants _still_ can't express positive/negative opinion

???

No ranked system satisfies the following criteria
- If everyone prefers X over Y, the group prefers X over Y
- If everyones preference of X to Y remains unchanged, the groups preference of X to Y remains unchanged despite changes to other preferences (e.g. X to Z, Y to Z, etc.)
- There is no 'dictator', a single voter with the power/knowledge to determine the groups preference

---

## Voting type: scoring

Give each option a rating.

<img src="img/votingStars.png" width=75%>

- numeric representation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- can (ambiguously) express positive/negative opinion

---

## Voting type: scoring

Give each option a rating.

<img src="img/votingEmojis.png" width=75%>

- numeric representation: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
- can unambiguously express positive/negative opinion
- scoring range 'breaks down' after 11 points (i.e. -5 to +5)

_(Consensus essentially allows you to score, but just the proposal.)_

---

## Combining: addition is OK

Simulation shows scoring results in best utility outcome, even with non-cooperative participants. (Note: 'Range' = 'Score')

<img src="img/bayesRegret.png" width=70%>

---

## Combining: re mutual-interest

However, direct addition equates positive and negative scores...

<img src="img/utilityBalanceEven.png" width=50%>

- e.g. _'negative two'_ plus _'two'_ equals zero

---

## Combining: negative score multiplication

Multiplying negative scores elevates acceptable over preferable. (e.g. "multiply negative scores by 3 before totalling")

<img src="img/utilityBalanceWeighted.png" width=50%>

- greater than 1
- less than ∞ (otherwise not enough motivation to do it)
- factor group dependent

_(Consensus essentially has a -∞ factor for the veto, again, just for the proposal!)_

---

class: center, middle

# How: summary

**Options:**
- include 'change nothing' as an option
- include 'revote on other options' as an option
- allow multiple proposals (but not _too_ many)

**Voting:**
- independent, not secret
- score each option
- positive/negative range, 3 - 11 points (e.g. -3 to +3)

**Combining:**
- multiply negative scores before totalling
- greater than 1, less than ∞ 

---

## Within a decision-making stack

Formal procedures take effort! Score voting comes after more fluid methods.

**Individual**  
- subconscious 
- norms
- executive decisions from role-bearers
- [doocracy](https://communitywiki.org/wiki/DoOcracy)
- [advice process](http://www.reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making)

>> **Sub-group**  
- informal
- consensus
- [consent](https://www.solutionsiq.com/resource/blog-post/consent-for-decision-making-in-agile-organizations/)

>>>> **Entire group**  
- consensus 
- consent 
- **weighted score voting with control options**
