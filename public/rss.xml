          <p>Although this isn’t the first post on this site, it is the first since it went up. Before this I was using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which needed go and seemed far too complicated. While far from satisfaction, I’d better swallow the bitter pill of the iterative philosophy I profess and publish my site changes so far, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>moving to <a href="https://metalsmith.io/">metalsmith</a></li>
<li>a posts section</li>
<li>simplified content</li>
<li>contact icons on first page</li>
<li>lot’s of ‘tidying’</li>
</ul>
<p>I intend to go into a bit more detail about the technical aspects later. For now I’ll say goodbye (world).</p>

          <h1>Talk: Post-consensus, cooperative decision-making</h1>
          <p>What should we do when consensus can’t be reached? What if cooperative decision-making is better achieved in such cases with practices other than “reaching consensus”?</p>
<p><img src="../postImages/pccdm_dmexpanded.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For decades people wishing to organize in more cooperative ways have been encouraged to make decisions by consensus, and for good reason: when it works well, it’s awesome. However—when it doesn’t work—it can lead to  guilt, frustration; organizational paralysis or disintegration.</p>
<p>In these talks I will explore how score voting can provide a simple, scalable and systematically cooperative alternative to the often utopian ideal of consensus—and explain how to do it.</p>

          <h1>Talk: Introducing Kanthaus</h1>
          <p>Two shabby buildings in a German town you’ve probably never heard of before have become home for a group of post-waste activists: we call it <a href="https://kanthaus.online">Kanthaus</a>. </p>
<p><img src="../postImages/sunnyDayKH.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Located within the mesh of global challenges is the fact that 1/3 of edible food isn’t eaten. The issue of waste is a focal point for our project, inherited from our involvement with <a href="https://yunity.org/en">yunity.org</a> and <a href="https://foodsharing.de/">foodsharing.de</a>. We believe that waste can be avoided, and relationsips built, through sharing. Kanthaus is a platform for people to promote sharing and/or reduce waste.</p>
<p>I fell into this project early on and I’ll present about the history, the first 6 months and future plans—</p>
<ul>
<li>on Friday 15th December, 17:30 as a standalone event at The Shrub, 13 Guthrie Street, Edinburgh EH1 1JG. This will be an interactive ~45 minute presentation with time for further discussion afterwards.
