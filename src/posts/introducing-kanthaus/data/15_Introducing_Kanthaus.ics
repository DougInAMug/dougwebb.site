SUMMARY:Introducing Kanthaus
URL:https%3A%2F%2Fdouginamug.gitlab.io%2Fpages%2Fevent%2Fintroducingkanthaus%2F
DESCRIPTION:Two shabby buildings in a German town you've probably never heard of before are now home to a small group of post-waste activists: we call it Kanthaus.\n\nWithin the mesh of global challenges is the fact that 1/3 of edible food isn't eaten. The issue of food waste has particular emphasis in Kanthaus due to a cultural heritage from yunity.org and foodhsharing.de. Foodsharing\, software development\, networking and organizational experimentation are some of our current activites. Food waste is reinforced through other issues which we also try to tackle. We disrupt the concept of property by implementing Commons and Cooperative prinicples: we challenge the role of money through collective budgeting and rejecting rent.\n\nHi\, I'm Doug and I was lucky enough to get involved in this thing from the beginning. I will present about how it came to be\, what's happened since we got the keys 6 months ago\, where we're going next and how you could get involved.
LOCATION:The Shrub\, 13 Guthrie Street\, Edinburgh\, EH1 1JG.
