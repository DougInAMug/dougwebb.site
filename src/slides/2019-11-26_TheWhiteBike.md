# The White Bike
## a.k.a. On-One Pompetamine Alfine 8
### a.k.a. Doug's bike

---

# Prelude
- Started biking a lot at Uni, 2011
- OK bike gifted to me by neighbor
- Lots of derailleur issues/brakes tweaking
- Eventually got stolen ;(

# A new bike
- Needed another bike
- In 2014 I would work for a company and commute by bike ~20 per day
- I wanted a 'good bike'
- I considered building my own, but I found a bike with all the things I wanted on offer for Â£600 and bought it April 2013

# On-One Pompetamine Alfine 8
- Specifically chosen for decent components inc. disc breaks + hub gear
- 2013 - 2015: heavy riding. I did a lot of maintainance and got to know the bike very well: it pretty much became an extension of my body.
- 2015 - 2017: mostly in storage while yunity-ing
- 2017: brought to Kanthaus

# Depersonalization
- Good:
  - Bike became regularly used because of good condition
  - Nick bike trailer hitch attached
  - Regularly used for dumpser diving
- Bad:
  - Bike light went missing
  - Seat post regularly not at my height
  - Lock/key often in different places
    - Bike cannot simply 'grabbed'
  - Missing component (brake cap) not replaced
    - Demotivating to do maintainance.
  - Use conflict with community re dumpster diving

## Two independent issues
- Community desire to have decent bike/trailer for dumpster diving.
- My desire to have a decent bike in a predictable state that I can take without discussion.

#' Options to solve both 'easily'
- We move the hitch to another bike and I personalize the white bike more
- We buy another hitch for another bike and I personalize the white bike more
- We keep the hitch on the white bike and I personalize another one
