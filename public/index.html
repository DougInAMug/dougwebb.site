    <h1>Hi, I'm Doug</h1>
    <p>I develop methods for effective cooperation, with a focus on post-consensus decision-making.</p>

    <p>Consensus decision-making has become the go-to method for groups wanting to decide together cooperatively. However it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve the conditions for consensus when groups get bigger, more diverse or dynamic—even groups which do achieve the conditions for consensus can fail to reach it. In the presentation <a href="https://douginamug.gitlab.io/slides/poco_coop_dm/#1">"Post-consensus, cooperative decision-making"</a>, I explore how to make decisions cooperatively when consensus isn't possible. <a href="https://ukuvota.world">Ukuvota</a> is an open-source web-app which implements all the features outlined in the presentation, developed by <a href="https://wolfi.space/">Wolfi</a>.</p>

    <p>A common house is owned, used and maintained by the same group. Common houses are great—and come with their own set of challanges! I wrote a constitution based on Elinor Ostrom's research into what makes commons successful for Kanthaus, (see below) where it is now collectively developed by its members: <a href="https://github.com/kanthaus/kanthaus.online/blob/master/user/pages/40.governance/10.constitution/default.en.md">Kanthaus Constitution</a>.</p>

    <p>I co-founded <a href="https://kanthaus.online">Kanthaus</a> to create a place for people to live and work together in a way that is social, ecological and economical. Together we are figuring out how to share a home and support each other reach our goals. Kanthaus doubles up lab for me to trial organizational innovations on willing subjects.</p>

    <p>So far this site is completely 'hand-written'. Until I figure out how I want to generate posts, check out the <a href="https://kanthaus.online/en/blog">Kanthaus blog</a> for a flavour of what I might be experiencing, or my <a href="https://medium.com/@DougInAMug">Medium</a> account for a few things I wrote a while ago.</p>

    <h1>More about...</h1>
    <h2>Work motivation</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of people voluntarily doing something to make things better/less bad: some occupy trees in threatened forests, others distribute surplus food before it's wasted, yet others consider how to make AI a benevolent force.</p>
    
    <p>When people voluntarily work together for the common good, they must be cooperating—right? After all, many issues such groups face are <i>caused</i> by a lack of cooperation in the first place.</p>
    
    <p>Not necessarily, as I've discovered after several years of volunteering with various initiatives. Some groups have cooperative values, but a lack of structure results in an authoritative or competitive experience. In other cases, groups adopt practices which are cooperative in theory, but not in practice.</p>
    
    <p>To address this failure to cooperate, I believe that philosophy and practice must be simultaneously inspected. Influenced by the works of Karl Popper and Elinor Ostrom, I use <i>autonomy</i>, <i>equivalence</i> and <i>mutual-interest</i> as a philosophical framework of cooperation. Regarding practice, I focus on decision-making since I've found it to be the practice groups struggle with most.</p>
    
    <p>What about Consensus, isn't that cooperative? Consensus decision-making is the practice of collaboratively developing a proposal everyone can accept (and preferably everyone likes.) Those that have thought through and teach Consensus have recognised a set of <a href="https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus#conditions">conditions</a> which must be present for the practice to succeed. However many groups attempt to use Consensus when these conditions can't be reached—even when it leads to stagnation, frustration and drop-out. In response to the cultural inertia of Consensus, and a seeming lack of alternatives when it's not achievable, I primarily come to the subject of decision-making from a 'post-consensus' perspective.</p>

    <p>I'm motivated to develop truly cooperative organizational practices because I believe they can help people be more effective, efficient and happy! It's my way of expressing gratitude to all those who are out there now, working together to solve issues and make life more worth living.</p>

    <h2>Relevant experiences</h2>
    <p>I was born and brought up in Scotland. My parents took my brothers and I to 'non-Western' countries when we were young. I read a book about a man who decided to live without money ('The Moneyless Man' by Marcus Boyle) when I was sixteen, which brought my 'get-rich' plan into question. While studying Chemistry at Edinburgh I got involved in student activism, coops and other such things. I worked for a multinational spirits company for a year investigating the how process variables affect Scotch Whisky flavour.</p>
    
    <p>Before my degree ended, I realised I didn't want to start a commercial job or do a PhD. Actually, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I planned to work-exchange and hitchhike around Europe. Two weeks into that plan, I happened to join the beginning of the yunity project. The idea was to recreate the foodsharing.de web-app as an open source, multilingual and extendable platform. My time with yunity was quite extraordinary: we hitchhiked from one meeting to another, were gifted accommodation and rescued most of our food from waste. I blogged about the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mindbleedofdoug/blog">first year</a>. Due to a variety of factors, the scope of yunity grew ever larger and the productivity towards the initial goal ever lower: with some bemusement I observed a team become a <a href="https://yunity.org/en">network</a>.</p>
    
    <p>A number of people I'd met along the way wanted to continue doing project work with a bit more stability. We got together to make what would become known as Kanthaus.</p>
        
    <h2>My idea of fun</h2>    
    <p>When I'm <i>not</i> doing cooperative process stuff I <del>club seals</del> hitch-hike, read sci-fi/surreal short-stories, do judo, climb trees, camp, watch insects, do yoga, explore abandoned building, forage, brew...</p>

    <h1>Contacting me</h1>
    <p>Generally, <b>email</b> is the best way to get in touch with me, but I'm still in the process of setting up a 'public' mailbox as of 2018-09-23</p>
    <p>You can find me on <b>Mastodon</b> (ActivityPub) quite regularly as <a href="https://mastodon.xyz/@douginamug">@douginamug@mastodon.xyz</a> If you haven't heard of Mastodon yet, it's quite exciting: see <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">joinmastodon.org</a> for more info.</p>
    <p><small>&emsp;I also have an account on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/DougInAMug">@douginamug</a>—sometimes I even check it.</small></p>
    
    <h1>Elsewhere online</h1>
    <p>I'm on <b>Gitlab</b> as <a href="https://gitlab.com/DougInAMug">@douginamug</a> where I store projects of varying degrees of completion, almost entirely non-code with the exception of this website. I use <b>GitHub</b> also as <a href="https://github.com/DougInAMug">@douginamug</a> less frequently, but for similar reasons.</p>
    <p><small>&emsp;I have published a few things on Medium, once again as <a href="https://medium.com/@DougInAMug">@douginamug</a></small></p>
