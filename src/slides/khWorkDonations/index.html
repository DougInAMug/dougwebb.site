# Intro
Kanthaus has a long history of financial criticism. Foodsharing was started as a moneyless project by a guy on money strike. yunity was also started as a moneyless project by the same guy (still on money strike.)

It became part of our unquestioned social fabric, part of our dogma. This dogma was finally surfaced when the search for a free wupphouse reached the 1.5 year mark. Several yunity people were put off Kanthaus because it was going to be bought.

A lot has changed, a lot has stayed the same. The topic is still an emotional one for many.

This presentation is about Kanthaus users working for money: the current situation and possible options.

---

name: assumptions
 
### Assumption 0
#### The global (economic) system is currently unsustainable
Biosphere depletion, 1/3 food wasted, poverty loops, etc, etc...

---

### Assumption 1
#### Money—the primary medium of said system—fails to accurately reflect real world value
Income does not necessary reflect the value of an individual or their labour.

---

### Assumption 2
#### Kanthaus is an island of sharing in a sea of exchange
Bought with donations, operating from the 'waste' of our system: residents can live without money. We want residents to work from gratitude and internal motivation to solve system problems.

---

### Assumption 3
#### We want Kanthaus and its residents to be 'financially healthy'
We want Kanthaus to continue, ideally with an annual income of ~€25k/year

Life outside of Kanthaus requires money. We don't want residents to become dependent on Kanthaus just because it's all they can afford. We want residents to be able start similar places to Kanthaus (i.e. have savings.) We want residents to retain most of their individuality.

---

### Assumption 4
#### Kanthaus won't provide residents a Very Basic Income
As far as I know, this is true. The current opinion seems to be that personal shared economies are separate from the Kanthaus institution. We therefore expect residents to be financially self-sufficient.

---

### Assumption 5
#### We want residents to care for themselves, Kanthaus and the wider world
Regrettably, people only have one body that they must share between these three purposes. Doing (paid) work which doesn't significantly help the wider world primary helps the worker care for themself.

---

### Assumption 6
#### Financial contribution to Kanthaus is valid and useful 
Also valid and useful: cleaning, cooking, repairing, community-caring, visitor-hosting, etc, etc... All contributions have [diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns) (i.e. the more you do it, the less useful it is.)

---

name: currentSituation

### Current situation
#### Overview
- _"it's OK to do some paid work, but not too much and you should still take part in CoMe/Power-hour/cooking/etc"_
- donation framework for resident workers same as visitors:
  - poster in entrance with rough running + improvement costs
  - donation shoe in entrance
  - bank details on webpage
  - _"donate as you feel"_

---

### Current situation
#### Advantages
- flexible
- people have been able to do some personal paid work without issue
- so far no evil capitalists have abused the commons

#### Issues
- vagueness -> social hierarchy
- people concerned to do 'too much' paid work
- people concerned to do 'too little' paid work
- people concerned they donate 'not enough' money as expected
- people concerned they're expected to donate 'too much' money

---

name: proposals

### Proposal 0
#### Change nothing
...

---

### Proposal 1
#### Daily rate
**Example:** We recommend all residents to donate €5 if they do any paid work from Kanthaus that day.

**Comment:** BAD! I'm putting this in as an example of a bad proposal. This proposal is [regressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_tax), meaning it would be disproportionately affect those working at a lower wage and/or lower hours:
- person A does an 8-hour development work day, earns €400 -> **€5 = ~1% of As income**
- person B does a 2 hour baby-sitting day, earns €20, €5 = **25% of Bs income**

---

### Proposal 2
#### Flat rate
**Example:** We recommend all residents donate 33% of their income.

**Comment:** BAD! Another regressive proposal. This proposal and previous proposal are systematically worse than the income tax codes in most Western countries.

---

### Proposal 3
#### Discuss at evaluations
We could just positively state the intentions of Kanthaus and that we are happy for people to care for themselves financially. The topic of working and donating would become a permanent topic during evaluations.

**Comment:** Flexible, but vague. Evaluations could become long and uncomfortable. Could be a way to deal with the large diversity between individual cases.

---

name: proposal4

### Proposal 4
#### Upper limits
We define some criteria which, if exceeded, leads to a discussion and case decision.

**Example:** Please meet and discuss with Volunteers and Members if you wish to do paid work:
- more than 10 hours per week, indefinitely
- more than 2 weeks continuous full-time in a 2 month period

**Comment:** It would perhaps make people doing small bits of paid work feel better about it. However, having a discussion to go over the criteria would be off-putting. Precisely how discussions would reach a satisfactory conclusion is not clear. It's also somewhat regressive due to wage differences (person with high wage can earn a lot more.)

---

### Proposal 5
#### 'Cap and trade'
We allocate a work allowance to each person (e.g. 1 day / 8 hours per week) and allow people to 'trade' this work allowance. 

**Example:** Person A wants to work full time. Person A persuades persons B, C, D and E to give them their allowances by committing to share some of the income with the people and the house. Person A can now work full time.

**Comment:** This is a decentralized way of making complex decisions. We would need to trust the judgement of individuals to appropriately distribute labor and income between themselves and Kanthaus. Could introduce internal 'exchange logic'.

---

### Proposal 6
#### [Progressive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax) recommendations based on income * time at Kanthaus
The following two proposals give numerical recommendations based on a persons 'Residence Adjusted Average Income':

$$RAAI = income\: over\: Period {No.\, days\: at\: Kanthaus\: over\: Period \over No.\, days\: in\: Period}$$

**Comment:** Conceptualizing donation in this way helps deal with 'non-regular work'—work which happens inside and out of the house, often online. This seems to be most of the work Kanthausers do. It doesn't require workers to detail their work at a very fine level.

---

### Proposal 6.1
#### Banded donation recommendation
We define a set of 'marginal rates' for donation recommendations, pretty much like how [progressive income tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax) works.

**Example:** For your RAAI over the last 3 months, we recommend you donate:

| RAAI interval   | Recommended donation of interval                  |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| 1st €1000       | 0%                                                |
| 2nd €1000       | 10%                                               |
| 3rd €1000       | 20%                                               |
| ...             | ...                                               |
| 10th €1000      | 90%                                               |
| 11th+ €1000     | Economic bug discovered! Why not donate it all?   |

**Comment:** Relatively simple system, quite easy to understand. [Diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns) incentivize people to 'work for money' only as much as they need, while still allowing people to earn 'enough'.

---

### Proposal 6.2
#### Smooth donation recommendation
Similar to previous example, except 'smooth'

**Example:** For your RAAI over the last 3 months, we recommend you donate:

$$recommended\: donation = RAAI^3 / 7.5*10^8$$

**Comment:** Aesthetic appeal. Progressive purity. Basically no incentive to 'game' under-earning. Not easy to estimate without calculating.

# Outro thoughts

- identifying, attracting and supporting 'good' work seems much more important than preventing people from doing paid work which 'neutral/bad'
- payment does no guarantee goodness: i.e. paid work might be 'good', unpaid work might be 'meh'
- Kanthaus seems to be half-way between community and institution. I believe we have a lot of trust. I think we should use it. (i.e. not primarilyy design against abusers/freeloaders/etc.)
