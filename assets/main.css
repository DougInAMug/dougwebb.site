/* ABOUT
 * I'm new to CSS, advice welcome! I'm trying to write this CSS 
 * 'mobile-first' with the default CSS being for mobile users (navbar at
 * bottom of screen for easier navigation) and '@media' queries at the 
 * end to modify CSS for larger devices (navbar at top.) It's 
 * 'top-to-bottom' from the perspective of the html (2019-02-05) */
 
/* NOTES TO SELF
 * Use external stylesheets
 *   Don't use inline styling
 *   Don't use internal styling
 * Style using classes
 *   Don't style tags ('elements')
 *   Don't style IDs
 * Don't use `!important`
 * Mobile first
 * Be BEMy http://getbem.com/
 *   Block     independent entity  .block          
 *   Element   dependent entity    .block__element 
 *   Modifier  entity modifier     .block--modifier
 * Margins collapse vertically
 *   Borders and padding don't.
 * 'max-width' shrinks, 'width' adds scrollbar
 * "Percent is a measurement unit relative to the containing block."
 * Initial setting for `display: flex;`
 *   flex-direction: row;
 *   flex-wrap: nowrap;
 *   justify-content: flex-start;
 *   align-content: stretch;

/* QUESTIONS
 * - can I use 'css-variables' natively with support? (e.g. `navbar-height`)
 * -
 */

/* FONTS
 * Fira Sans, its derivatives and Libre Baskerville were served from google with:
 * 
 *  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fira+Sans|Fira+Sans+Condensed|Fira+Sans+Extra+Condensed|Libre+Baskerville');
 * 
 * but I've disabled this as I'd rather avoid the goog. 
 * 2019-02-05 looks like Firefox now has fira inbuilt... what coverage is there?
 */
 
/* All gone! 2019-02-05
 * 
 * In the quest for best practice, I've moved all my css to shame.css until I go over it properly. After cleaning it up, I'll bring the good stuff back here
