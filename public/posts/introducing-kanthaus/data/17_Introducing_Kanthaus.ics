SUMMARY:Introducing Kanthaus @ Lightening Lectures: LivingRoomLectures turns 2
DESCRIPTION:# Introducing Kanthaus\n\nTwo shabby buildings in a German town you've probably never heard of before have become home for a group of post-waste activists: we call it Kanthaus.\n\nLocated within the mesh of global challenges is the fact that 1/3 of edible food isn't eaten. The issue of waste is a focal point for our project\, inherited from our involvement with yunity.org and foodsharing.de. We believe that most waste is due to outdated economics and that sharing provides solutions. Kanthaus is a platform for people promote sharing and/or reduce waste.\n\nI fell into this project early on and I'll present about the history\, first 6 months and future plans in a ~5 minute flash-talk.\n\nOriginally posted here: https://douginamug.gitlab.io/post/2017-12-04_introducingkanthaus/\n\n------\n\n# Lightening Lectures\n\nWE'VE MADE IT TO LIVING ROOM LECTURES' 2ND BIRTHDAY !! & we're going to throw a shindig to celebrate!\n\nSunday 17th December\nG.A.S//53 Kilbirnie St\, Glasgow G5 8JD5\nThere will be food from 5 and a cheap bar running from 8PM\nFree in but donations welcome\n\n5-6PM\nThere will be FOOD [!] and an exhibition of our anniversary pamphlet/zine with contributions from past lecturers\, artwork\, stories and anecdotes on learning\, living rooms and more besides.\n\n7-8.30PM\nwe'll get on with the LIGHTENING LECTURES !! a series of 3-5 minute talks followed by a 5-7 minute discussion. 10 MINUTES MAX to test any ideas/projects/thoughts you've had going on.\nso far we've got ..\nCee Smith with some period chat / Victoria McNulty with a lightening lecture about Capitalism and Travel / James McAveety discussing the album 'The La's'\, by The La's / Adam Cheshire with some chat about mimetics / Gabe Featherstone with a song about moral hygiene and vegetables\nMORE YET TO BE ANNOUNCED ! / give us a message if u want a shot\n\n8.30-10PM\nLive music.
